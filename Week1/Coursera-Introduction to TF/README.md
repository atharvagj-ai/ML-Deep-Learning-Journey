# Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
### Link to the course : https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow

This covers the basics of all the Tensorfloe concepts and lays a firm foundation for learning the advanced concepts.
Here is what I learnt week by week! 

#### Week 1 - It covered how to build a basic Nueral Network by Tensorflow. Made a basic regression model for Housing Price prediction. 

#### Week 2 - It covered the basics of Computer Vision. Created a Handwriting recognition model by designing a very basic nueral network which recognized the features of the image data. The dataset used was MNIST dataset.

### Week 3 - It covered the concepts of Convolutions and Pooling, which help to improve our CV Model by enhancing the significant features of the images. Created a DNN with Tensorflow.

### Week 4 - This week incorporated all the concepts of previous weeks. Here, I made a Model which classified Happy and Sad faces. While learning, you'll also make a CovNet for making a Happy and Sad Classifier. 

At the end of this course, I now have understood the basics of Tensorflow and Image Processing. I can now build and edit various image classifier models and can work on techniques to improve them.
